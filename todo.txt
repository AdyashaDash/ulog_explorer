when switching logfile and one topic is not present several topics are not plotted
use pyqtgraph.exit() to exit
investigate memory leak when adding curve to plot
fix issue with directory as argument
remove pandas? (maybe not. Opening a 250 Mb file takes 7.5s with only ULog and 8.5s with converting to df)
add support for secondary logfile as second command argument
add a callback to print the parameter diff to console
support drag and drop a logfile onto a graph
